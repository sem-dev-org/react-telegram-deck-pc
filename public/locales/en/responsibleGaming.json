        "content": "<p class=\"leading-7\">Gambling should always be a form of entertainment. In order to assist you in keeping your gambling activities fun, <a href={{gameUrl}} class=\"text-primary font-bold text-sm\">{{gameName}}</a> has a range of responsible gambling tools which you are able to make use of at any point in time. Play for fun, not for funds.</p><br /><p class=\"text-lg leading-7 font-bold\">Gambling Limits</p><br /><p class=\"text-base leading-7 font-semibold\">Loss limit</p><p class=\"leading-7\">A loss limit allows you to set a limit on how much you can afford to lose over your set period of time. The limit can be set over a period of one day, one week or one month. It is a net loss limit. Profits made during your set period will not count towards your limit amount. If you are profitable during the set period, you are able to use your profits to continue to wager and bet until you reach your loss limit. Unsettled bets count towards the limit. Please check your unsettled bets if you are unable to place bets, as these unsettled bets may cause you to reach your limit.</p><br /><p class=\"text-base leading-7 font-semibold\">Wager limit</p><p class=\"leading-7\">A wager limit (or betting limit) allows you to set a limit on how much you can wager over your set period of time. The maximum bet limit can be set over a period of one day, one week or one month. The limit is not a net limit, so profits are excluded. This means, if you are profitable during the period, these profits are not offset against your maximum bet limit. Decreasing an existing limit is effective immediately. To increase your limits, your new limit will be subject to a 24-hour cool off period before your new limit takes effect.</p><br /><p class=\"text-base leading-7 font-semibold\">Self-Exclusion</p><p class=\"leading-7\">A self-exclusion tool offers the ability to suspend all access to your account should you feel that you are at risk of developing a gambling problem, or in some cases, believe you currently have one.</p><br /><p class=\"leading-7\">The available periods are as follows:</p><ol class=\"pl-2 leading-7\"><li><span class=\"\">• </span> 6 Months</li><li><span class=\"\">• </span> 1 Year</li><li><span class=\"\">• </span> Indefinite</li></ol><p class=\"leading-7\">In the event an indefinite exclusion is set, access to your account(s) will remain blocked until such a time should you actively request to revoke the indefinite exclusion. The indefinite exclusion imposes a minimum exclusion period of at least 6 months, from the date of application. Once the 6 month period has lapsed, your account can be considered for reactivation subject to a formal return to play review. In order to initiate the review process, please contact our support team via email.</p><br /><p class=\"text-base leading-7 font-semibold\">Temporary Exclusion</p><p class=\"leading-7\"><a href={{gameUrl}} class=\"text-primary font-bold text-sm\">{{gameName}}</a> also provides alternative options to suspend your account temporarily, known as temporary exclusion. Whether you would like to take a break from gambling to re-evaluate your personal goals, save some money or simply spend time on other activities, the option is made available to you.</p><br /><p class=\"leading-7\">The available periods are as follows:</p><ol class=\"pl-2 leading-7\"><li><span class=\"\">• </span> 1 Day</li><li><span class=\"\">• </span> 1 Week</li><li><span class=\"\">• </span> 1 Month</li><li><span class=\"\">• </span> 3 Months</li></ol><br /><p class=\"leading-7\">Note: <a href={{gameUrl}} class=\"text-primary font-bold text-sm\">{{gameName}}</a> reserves the right to self-exclude a customers account should we determine that gambling may not be safe for you to continue.</p><br /><p class=\"text-base leading-7 font-semibold\">Application of Temporary Exclusion or Self-Exclusion</p><ol class=\"list-decimal pl-4 leading-7\"><li><span class=\"font-medium\"></span>Upon initial application, your account will enter into a 24 hour cooling off period</li><li><span class=\"font-medium\"></span>Once the 24 hour cooling off period has lapsed, you will be presented with the applicable timeframes</li><li><span class=\"font-medium\"></span>In the event no self-exclusion period is selected, your account will reopen automatically</li><li><span class=\"font-medium\"></span>No further activity will be permitted once the exclusion has been applied and taken effect</li><li><span class=\"font-medium\"></span>It will not be possible to reactivate your account until the chosen time period has lapsed</li><li><span class=\"font-medium\"></span>Where a defined self-exclusion is in effect, your account will automatically reactivate once the chosen time period has lapsed</li><li><span class=\"font-medium\"></span>Where an indefinite self-exclusion is in effect, whether applied by the client or operator, a minimum of 6 months must pass before the account can be considered for review</li></ol><br /><p class=\"text-base leading-7 font-semibold\">Closing My <a href={{gameUrl}} class=\"text-primary font-bold text-sm\">{{gameName}}</a> Account</p><p class=\"leading-7\"><a href={{gameUrl}} class=\"text-primary font-bold text-sm\">{{gameName}}</a> provides the option to close your account should you wish.
